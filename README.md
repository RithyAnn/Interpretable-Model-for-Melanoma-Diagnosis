# Interpretable-Model-for-Melanoma-Diagnosis

This project presents a prototype-based autoencoder designed for melanoma detection, integrating feature importance with example-based explanations to enhance interpretability.

**Key Features:**
Enhanced Architecture: Optimized network structure, distance strategies, and parameter selection improve model performance and applicability.
Iterative Optimization: Fine-tunes parameters based on model loss and prototype image quality for optimal results.
Interpretable Representation: Extracts and visualizes feature and prototype vectors, with decoder layers reconstructing key features and prototype images to illustrate clustering.
Instance-Based Explanations: Decisions are supported by reconstructed prototype images, providing a transparent and explainable melanoma detection process.
This model bridges deep learning and interpretability, offering a more transparent, reliable, and practically applicable approach to AI-driven melanoma diagnosis.
